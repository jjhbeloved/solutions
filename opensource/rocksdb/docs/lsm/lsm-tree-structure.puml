rectangle "内存层" {
  rectangle "活跃MemTable" as MT1
  rectangle "不可变MemTable" as MT2
}

rectangle "磁盘层" {
  rectangle "Level 0" as L0 {
    rectangle "SST File 1" as SST1
    rectangle "SST File 2" as SST2
    rectangle "SST File 3" as SST3
  }

    rectangle "SST File 7" as SST7
    rectangle "SST File 8" as SST8
    rectangle "SST File 9" as SST9
  }
}

MT1 -down-> MT2 : 达到大小阈值
MT2 -down-> L0 : 刷盘
L0 -down-> L1 : 压缩
L1 -down-> L2 : 压缩

note right of MT1 : 接收所有写入操作
note right of MT2 : 等待刷盘到磁盘
note right of L0 : 文件可能有重叠键范围
note right of L1 : 文件键范围不重叠
note bottom of L2 : 容量通常是上一层的10倍
